## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the value of computational text analysis in revealing subtle yet significant shifts in curriculum emphasis. By applying NLP techniques to Turkish mathematics curricula from 2018 and 2024, we identified quantifiable changes in the emphasis on AI-relevant competencies.

The evolution toward greater AI readiness in mathematics education appears to be an organic response to changing societal needs rather than an explicitly stated policy goal. This suggests that educational systems have inherent adaptive mechanisms that respond to technological shifts.

For mathematics education policy, these findings highlight the importance of intentionally building upon these emerging trends to more systematically prepare students for an AI-integrated future. Future curriculum revisions could benefit from explicitly identifying AI literacy as a core competency and further strengthening the mathematical foundations that support it.

Methodologically, this research demonstrates how NLP techniques can unveil implicit curriculum transformations that traditional analyses might overlook. This computational approach offers a powerful complement to traditional qualitative curriculum analysis methods.

Future research could expand this approach to cross-national comparisons, tracking how mathematics curricula are evolving in response to AI across different educational systems and cultural contexts.
