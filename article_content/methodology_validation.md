## Methodology Validation
    
    Applying NLP techniques to Turkish mathematics curriculum documents presents specific challenges that 
    required methodological adaptations and validation steps.
    
    ### Turkish Language Processing Considerations
    
    Turkish, as an agglutinative language with complex morphological structure, requires specialized 
    preprocessing. We implemented:
    
    - Custom lemmatization to handle the rich morphological variations in Turkish mathematical terminology
    - Adaptation of spaCy models with Turkish-specific adjustments
    - Development of specialized stopword lists relevant to mathematics education in Turkish
    
    ### Cross-Validation Approach
    
    To validate our computational findings, we implemented several cross-validation strategies:
    
    1. **Multiple NLP Method Triangulation**: We compared results across different NLP approaches 
       (frequency analysis, topic modeling, and classification) to identify consistent patterns.
       
    2. **Manual Review by Domain Experts**: A random sample of 10% of learning objectives was manually 
       reviewed by mathematics education experts to validate the AI-relevance classifications.
       
    3. **Benchmark Against Established Frameworks**: We compared our findings against international 
       frameworks for AI education competencies, including the OECD Learning Compass 2030 and 
       UNESCO's AI competency framework.
       
    4. **Statistical Validation**: For topic modeling, we optimized coherence scores and tested 
       multiple parameter configurations to ensure stable and interpretable results.
    
    Agreement rates between computational classifications and expert judgments reached 83%, indicating 
    strong validity for our approach. Disagreements primarily occurred with objectives that used 
    domain-specific terminology with implicit rather than explicit connections to AI competencies.
