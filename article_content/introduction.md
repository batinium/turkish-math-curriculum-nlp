## Introduction
    
    As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into society, education systems worldwide 
    are evolving to prepare students for this technological shift. Mathematics education, in particular, 
    provides the foundational skills needed for AI literacy - from algorithmic thinking to pattern recognition, 
    from data analysis to logical reasoning. However, these shifts in curriculum focus are often implicit 
    rather than explicitly labeled as AI preparation.
    
    This study employs computational methods to analyze how the Turkish mathematics curriculum has evolved 
    between 2018 and 2024, focusing on identifying changes that align with AI readiness competencies. Rather 
    than relying solely on traditional qualitative curriculum analysis, we use natural language processing (NLP) 
    techniques to systematically identify patterns and shifts that might otherwise remain undetected.
    
    Our research questions include:
    
    1. How has the emphasis on different mathematical competencies shifted between the 2018 and 2024 curricula?
    2. To what extent do these shifts align with competencies needed for AI literacy?
    3. What implicit patterns in curriculum language reveal an evolution toward AI readiness?
    4. How can computational text analysis provide unique insights into curriculum transformation?
    
    By applying text mining, topic modeling, and semantic analysis to curriculum documents, we aim to provide 
    quantitative evidence of how mathematics education is evolving in response to technological changes, 
    even when these responses are not explicitly framed in terms of AI preparation.
