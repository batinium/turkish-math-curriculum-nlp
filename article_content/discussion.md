## Discussion

The results of our computational analysis demonstrate a clear evolution in the Turkish mathematics curriculum toward incorporating more AI-relevant competencies. Even without explicit references to artificial intelligence, the 2024 curriculum shows a measurable shift toward mathematical skills that form the foundation of AI literacy.

Several key trends emerged from our analysis:

1. **Increased emphasis on pattern recognition and data analysis**: The dramatic increase in terminology related to patterns, relationships, and data indicates a curriculum evolving to emphasize skills central to understanding algorithmic thinking and machine learning concepts.

2. **Shift toward higher-order cognitive skills**: The increased usage of verbs associated with analysis, evaluation, and creation suggests a movement away from rote calculation toward the complex reasoning skills needed in an AI-integrated world.

3. **Greater focus on computational thinking**: The 2024 curriculum shows stronger alignment with computational thinking frameworks, preparing students for the algorithmic reasoning required for AI literacy.

4. **Evolution in mathematical topics**: Topic modeling revealed new emphasis areas in the 2024 curriculum that align with AI-readiness, particularly in relation to problem-solving approaches and data representation.

These shifts suggest that mathematics education is implicitly responding to changing societal needs, even when policy documents may not explicitly reference AI literacy as a goal. This "hidden curriculum" evolution demonstrates how educational systems naturally adapt to emerging technological demands.
