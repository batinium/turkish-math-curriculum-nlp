## Results

Our computational analysis of the Turkish mathematics curricula from 2018 and 2024 revealed several significant shifts in content and emphasis, particularly those related to AI readiness competencies:

1. The 2024 curriculum has 801 learning objectives compared to 278 in 2018, a increase of 188.1%.
2. The average sentence length increased from 6.3 to 13.6 words (117.0% change), suggesting higher linguistic complexity in the 2024 curriculum.
3. Computational thinking relevance has increased by inf% in the 2024 curriculum, indicating stronger alignment with computational thinking skills needed for AI literacy.
4. Mathematical reasoning relevance has increased by inf% in the 2024 curriculum, suggesting enhanced focus on critical reasoning skills that underpin AI understanding.
5. Pattern recognition relevance has increased by inf% in the 2024 curriculum, indicating greater emphasis on identifying patterns and relationships, a core skill in machine learning.
6. Use of higher-order thinking verbs (analyze, evaluate, compare, design, create) has increased by 1033.3% in the 2024 curriculum, suggesting stronger emphasis on complex cognitive skills needed for AI literacy.
7. The proportion of learning objectives with high AI relevance has decreased from 1.1% to 0.9% (0.2 percentage points), indicating a weaker focus on AI-ready mathematical competencies.
8. The 2024 curriculum has 2 topics with above-average AI relevance compared to 1 in 2018, representing a shift in thematic focus toward AI-ready skills.
