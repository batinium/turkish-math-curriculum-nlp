## Limitations
    
    While our computational approach provides valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged:
    
    ### Language Processing Challenges
    
    Despite using specialized tools for Turkish language processing, some linguistic nuances may have been 
    missed. Turkish mathematical terminology presents challenges for automated analysis due to:
    
    - Limited availability of specialized NLP resources for Turkish mathematical discourse
    - Complex morphological structure that can create ambiguities in word sense disambiguation
    - Domain-specific terms that may have different meanings in mathematical versus general contexts
    
    ### Curriculum Document Constraints
    
    Our analysis was limited to the official curriculum documents, which may not fully capture:
    
    - Actual classroom implementation and emphasis
    - Supplementary materials and resources used by teachers
    - Informal or implicit curriculum goals not documented in official texts
    
    ### Methodological Limitations
    
    The computational methods employed have inherent limitations:
    
    - Topic modeling is sensitive to parameter choices and preprocessing decisions
    - Exact comparison between curriculum versions is challenging due to structural differences
    - The AI relevance lexicon, while carefully developed, represents a specific operationalization 
      of AI readiness that may not capture all aspects of AI education
    
    ### Generalizability Considerations
    
    The findings are specific to the Turkish educational context and may not generalize to other:
    
    - Educational systems with different structures and approaches to mathematics education
    - Cultural contexts with different perspectives on technology integration
    - Languages with different ways of expressing mathematical concepts
    
    Despite these limitations, the consistent patterns observed across multiple analytical approaches 
    provide confidence in the overall trends identified, while suggesting caution in interpreting 
    specific quantitative comparisons.
