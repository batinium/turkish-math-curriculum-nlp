## Methodology
    
    This study employed a computational approach to curriculum analysis, applying various natural language 
    processing techniques to identify patterns and changes between the 2018 and 2024 Turkish mathematics curricula.
    
    ### Data Collection and Preprocessing
    
    The primary data sources were the official Turkish mathematics curriculum documents from 2018 and 2024. 
    These documents were preprocessed through the following steps:
    
    1. Text extraction and cleaning to remove irrelevant formatting
    2. Tokenization and normalization of Turkish text
    3. Segmentation by curriculum sections and learning objectives
    4. Extraction of linguistic features using NLP tools adapted for Turkish language
    
    ### Analysis Approaches
    
    Multiple complementary NLP methods were applied:
    
    #### 1. Lexical Analysis
    
    We conducted frequency analysis of terms in both curricula, calculating both absolute and relative frequencies. 
    Special attention was given to terms associated with AI-relevant mathematical competencies, including computational 
    thinking, mathematical reasoning, pattern recognition, and data concepts.
    
    #### 2. Verb Analysis for Cognitive Demand
    
    We extracted and categorized verbs according to Bloom's Taxonomy to assess shifts in cognitive demands, 
    with particular focus on higher-order thinking skills essential for AI literacy.
    
    #### 3. Topic Modeling
    
    Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to discover hidden thematic structures within the curriculum 
    documents. This unsupervised learning approach helped identify clusters of related concepts and how their 
    emphasis has changed over time.
    
    #### 4. AI Relevance Classification
    
    We developed a custom classification scheme to assess the AI relevance of each learning objective based on 
    its linguistic features and content. This allowed for quantifying the shift toward AI-relevant competencies.
    
    #### 5. Semantic Network Analysis
    
    By mapping semantic relationships between curriculum concepts, we constructed network visualizations that 
    highlight evolving connections between mathematical domains and AI-relevant skills.
    
    ### Validation Approach
    
    To ensure the validity of our computational findings, we employed a mixed-methods validation strategy:
    
    1. Cross-validation between different NLP approaches
    2. Manual review of a sample of categorized learning objectives by mathematics education experts
    3. Comparison with international frameworks for AI education competencies
    
    This methodological approach combines the systematic rigor of computational analysis with domain expertise in 
    mathematics education and AI literacy.
