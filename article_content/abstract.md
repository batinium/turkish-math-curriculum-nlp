This study employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the evolution of the Turkish 
    mathematics curriculum from 2018 to 2024, with a specific focus on how these changes reflect 
    increasing AI literacy demands. Using computational text analysis, topic modeling, and semantic network 
    analysis, we identify significant shifts in mathematical competencies that align with AI readiness. 
    Our findings reveal changes in curriculum emphasis toward pattern recognition, computational thinking, 
    mathematical reasoning, and data analysis - all essential foundations for AI literacy. The analysis 
    demonstrates how NLP methodologies can reveal implicit curriculum transformations that traditional 
    analyses might miss, offering insights into how mathematics education is evolving to meet the 
    demands of an AI-integrated future.
