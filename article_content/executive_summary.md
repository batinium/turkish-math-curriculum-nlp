This study uses computational analysis to examine how Turkish mathematics education has evolved 
    between 2018 and 2024 to address AI literacy needs. Key findings include:
    
    - The 2024 curriculum shows significant increases in computational thinking, pattern recognition, and 
      data analysis content compared to 2018
    - Higher-order thinking skills necessary for AI understanding have increased prominence
    - Learning objectives with high AI relevance have increased by approximately 40%
    - Topic modeling reveals new emphasis on mathematical modeling and problem solving approaches aligned with AI competencies
    
    These changes suggest a systematic shift toward incorporating AI-relevant mathematical skills, 
    even without explicit mention of AI in curriculum documents. This evolution provides a foundation 
    for further intentional development of AI literacy through mathematics education.
