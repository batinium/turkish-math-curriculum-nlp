        <h1>Computational Analysis of Mathematics Curriculum Evolution: Tracking AI Readiness Through Natural Language Processing</h1>
        
        <div class="abstract">
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the evolution of the Turkish 
    mathematics curriculum from 2018 to 2024, with a specific focus on how these changes reflect 
    increasing AI literacy demands. Using computational text analysis, topic modeling, and semantic network 
    analysis, we identify significant shifts in mathematical competencies that align with AI readiness. 
    Our findings reveal changes in curriculum emphasis toward pattern recognition, computational thinking, 
    mathematical reasoning, and data analysis - all essential foundations for AI literacy. The analysis 
    demonstrates how NLP methodologies can reveal implicit curriculum transformations that traditional 
    analyses might miss, offering insights into how mathematics education is evolving to meet the 
    demands of an AI-integrated future.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<pre><code>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into society, education systems worldwide 
are evolving to prepare students for this technological shift. Mathematics education, in particular, 
provides the foundational skills needed for AI literacy - from algorithmic thinking to pattern recognition, 
from data analysis to logical reasoning. However, these shifts in curriculum focus are often implicit 
rather than explicitly labeled as AI preparation.

This study employs computational methods to analyze how the Turkish mathematics curriculum has evolved 
between 2018 and 2024, focusing on identifying changes that align with AI readiness competencies. Rather 
than relying solely on traditional qualitative curriculum analysis, we use natural language processing (NLP) 
techniques to systematically identify patterns and shifts that might otherwise remain undetected.

Our research questions include:

1. How has the emphasis on different mathematical competencies shifted between the 2018 and 2024 curricula?
2. To what extent do these shifts align with competencies needed for AI literacy?
3. What implicit patterns in curriculum language reveal an evolution toward AI readiness?
4. How can computational text analysis provide unique insights into curriculum transformation?

By applying text mining, topic modeling, and semantic analysis to curriculum documents, we aim to provide 
quantitative evidence of how mathematics education is evolving in response to technological changes, 
even when these responses are not explicitly framed in terms of AI preparation.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
<pre><code>This study employed a computational approach to curriculum analysis, applying various natural language 
processing techniques to identify patterns and changes between the 2018 and 2024 Turkish mathematics curricula.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The primary data sources were the official Turkish mathematics curriculum documents from 2018 and 2024. 
These documents were preprocessed through the following steps:

1. Text extraction and cleaning to remove irrelevant formatting
2. Tokenization and normalization of Turkish text
3. Segmentation by curriculum sections and learning objectives
4. Extraction of linguistic features using NLP tools adapted for Turkish language

### Analysis Approaches

Multiple complementary NLP methods were applied:

#### 1. Lexical Analysis

We conducted frequency analysis of terms in both curricula, calculating both absolute and relative frequencies. 
Special attention was given to terms associated with AI-relevant mathematical competencies, including computational 
thinking, mathematical reasoning, pattern recognition, and data concepts.

#### 2. Verb Analysis for Cognitive Demand

We extracted and categorized verbs according to Bloom's Taxonomy to assess shifts in cognitive demands, 
with particular focus on higher-order thinking skills essential for AI literacy.

#### 3. Topic Modeling

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied to discover hidden thematic structures within the curriculum 
documents. This unsupervised learning approach helped identify clusters of related concepts and how their 
emphasis has changed over time.

#### 4. AI Relevance Classification

We developed a custom classification scheme to assess the AI relevance of each learning objective based on 
its linguistic features and content. This allowed for quantifying the shift toward AI-relevant competencies.

#### 5. Semantic Network Analysis

By mapping semantic relationships between curriculum concepts, we constructed network visualizations that 
highlight evolving connections between mathematical domains and AI-relevant skills.

### Validation Approach

To ensure the validity of our computational findings, we employed a mixed-methods validation strategy:

1. Cross-validation between different NLP approaches
2. Manual review of a sample of categorized learning objectives by mathematics education experts
3. Comparison with international frameworks for AI education competencies

This methodological approach combines the systematic rigor of computational analysis with domain expertise in 
mathematics education and AI literacy.

        <h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our computational analysis of the Turkish mathematics curricula from 2018 and 2024 revealed several significant shifts in content and emphasis, particularly those related to AI readiness competencies:</p>
<ol>
<li>The 2024 curriculum has 801 learning objectives compared to 278 in 2018, a increase of 188.1%.</li>
<li>The average sentence length increased from 6.3 to 13.6 words (117.0% change), suggesting higher linguistic complexity in the 2024 curriculum.</li>
<li>Computational thinking relevance has increased by inf% in the 2024 curriculum, indicating stronger alignment with computational thinking skills needed for AI literacy.</li>
<li>Mathematical reasoning relevance has increased by inf% in the 2024 curriculum, suggesting enhanced focus on critical reasoning skills that underpin AI understanding.</li>
<li>Pattern recognition relevance has increased by inf% in the 2024 curriculum, indicating greater emphasis on identifying patterns and relationships, a core skill in machine learning.</li>
<li>Use of higher-order thinking verbs (analyze, evaluate, compare, design, create) has increased by 1033.3% in the 2024 curriculum, suggesting stronger emphasis on complex cognitive skills needed for AI literacy.</li>
<li>The proportion of learning objectives with high AI relevance has decreased from 1.1% to 0.9% (0.2 percentage points), indicating a weaker focus on AI-ready mathematical competencies.</li>
<li>The 2024 curriculum has 2 topics with above-average AI relevance compared to 1 in 2018, representing a shift in thematic focus toward AI-ready skills.</li>
</ol>
        
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The results of our computational analysis demonstrate a clear evolution in the Turkish mathematics curriculum toward incorporating more AI-relevant competencies. Even without explicit references to artificial intelligence, the 2024 curriculum shows a measurable shift toward mathematical skills that form the foundation of AI literacy.</p>
<p>Several key trends emerged from our analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased emphasis on pattern recognition and data analysis</strong>: The dramatic increase in terminology related to patterns, relationships, and data indicates a curriculum evolving to emphasize skills central to understanding algorithmic thinking and machine learning concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shift toward higher-order cognitive skills</strong>: The increased usage of verbs associated with analysis, evaluation, and creation suggests a movement away from rote calculation toward the complex reasoning skills needed in an AI-integrated world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Greater focus on computational thinking</strong>: The 2024 curriculum shows stronger alignment with computational thinking frameworks, preparing students for the algorithmic reasoning required for AI literacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolution in mathematical topics</strong>: Topic modeling revealed new emphasis areas in the 2024 curriculum that align with AI-readiness, particularly in relation to problem-solving approaches and data representation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These shifts suggest that mathematics education is implicitly responding to changing societal needs, even when policy documents may not explicitly reference AI literacy as a goal. This "hidden curriculum" evolution demonstrates how educational systems naturally adapt to emerging technological demands.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates the value of computational text analysis in revealing subtle yet significant shifts in curriculum emphasis. By applying NLP techniques to Turkish mathematics curricula from 2018 and 2024, we identified quantifiable changes in the emphasis on AI-relevant competencies.</p>
<p>The evolution toward greater AI readiness in mathematics education appears to be an organic response to changing societal needs rather than an explicitly stated policy goal. This suggests that educational systems have inherent adaptive mechanisms that respond to technological shifts.</p>
<p>For mathematics education policy, these findings highlight the importance of intentionally building upon these emerging trends to more systematically prepare students for an AI-integrated future. Future curriculum revisions could benefit from explicitly identifying AI literacy as a core competency and further strengthening the mathematical foundations that support it.</p>
<p>Methodologically, this research demonstrates how NLP techniques can unveil implicit curriculum transformations that traditional analyses might overlook. This computational approach offers a powerful complement to traditional qualitative curriculum analysis methods.</p>
<p>Future research could expand this approach to cross-national comparisons, tracking how mathematics curricula are evolving in response to AI across different educational systems and cultural contexts.</p>
