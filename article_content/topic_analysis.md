## Comparative Topic Analysis
    
    Our topic modeling approach revealed significant shifts in mathematical emphasis between the 
    2018 and 2024 curricula. Here we examine the evolution of specific mathematical topics and 
    their alignment with AI-relevant competencies.
    
    ### Evolution of Data and Statistics Topics
    
    In the 2018 curriculum, topics related to data and statistics focused primarily on basic 
    descriptive statistics and graphical representation. The 2024 curriculum shows a marked 
    shift toward more sophisticated data concepts, including:
    
    - Increased emphasis on data relationships and correlations
    - New focus on inferential approaches to data analysis
    - Introduction of simulations and modeling of random phenomena
    - Greater attention to interpretation and critical evaluation of statistical results
    
    This evolution aligns closely with data literacy needs for AI understanding, where students 
    must develop comfort with statistical reasoning and data-based decision making.
    
    ### Pattern Recognition and Algebraic Thinking
    
    The topic modeling reveals an interesting evolution in how patterns and algebraic thinking 
    are addressed:
    
    - 2018 curriculum: Pattern topics primarily connected to sequence recognition and basic 
      function properties
    - 2024 curriculum: Pattern topics significantly more connected to generalization, abstraction, 
      and algorithmic thinking
    
    This shift represents a deeper integration of computational thinking principles into 
    algebraic reasoning, a critical foundation for algorithmic literacy.
    
    ### Problem-Solving Approaches
    
    A notable evolution appears in problem-solving topics:
    
    - 2018 curriculum: Problem-solving primarily framed as applying known procedures to routine problems
    - 2024 curriculum: Problem-solving increasingly connected to modeling, abstraction, and analysis 
      of complex systems
    
    This shift toward modeling complex problems and identifying patterns within them directly 
    supports the development of computational thinking skills essential for AI literacy.
